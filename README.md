# odin-recipes

This project presents a few recipes. The goal is to showcase the HTML skills learned so far through the Odin Project curriculum. These skills include: setting up a html file with the proper boilerplate information, creating a header, body, lists (unordered, ordered), varying sized font, bolded and italicized text, images, links (relative), and paragraph format.
