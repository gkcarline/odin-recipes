          <p><h3>This is a delightfully easy recipe for a quick dessert. The cake is always moist and light and is beautifully balanced between tart and sweet. Perhaps technically classified as a coffee cake, this apple cake is so simple- you don't even have to peel the apples if you don't want to.</h3></p>
